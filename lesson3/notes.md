# Lesson 3

## Impetus ("impetus" refers to the driving force or motivation) behind the use of patterns:
- Designing reusable software is hard: Creating software that can be easily reused in different contexts is challenging. It requires careful planning and design to ensure that the software components are flexible, modular, and adaptable to various scenarios. Achieving reusability involves addressing different requirements and anticipating future changes, which can be complex.
  
- Novices are overwhelmed: Beginners in software development often find it difficult to manage the complexity of designing software. They might struggle with understanding best practices, design principles, and the nuances of creating efficient and maintainable code. The sheer volume of information and the number of decisions that need to be made can be overwhelming for those who are new to the field.
  
- Experts draw from experience: Experienced developers rely on their knowledge and past experiences to solve problems and design software. They have encountered various challenges and have learned effective solutions over time. This experience allows them to recognize patterns and apply proven techniques to new problems, making their design process more efficient and effective.
  
- Some design solutions reoccur: Certain problems and solutions tend to appear repeatedly in software development. These recurring solutions, known as patterns, address common challenges that arise in many projects. By identifying and documenting these patterns, developers can apply them to new situations, saving time and effort.

- Understanding reoccuring solutions in beneficial in several ways.
   - Efficiency: By using established patterns, developers can avoid reinventing the wheel and quickly implement solutions that are known to work.
   - Consistency: Patterns provide a consistent approach to solving problems, making the software more predictable and easier to maintain.
   - Communication: Patterns serve as a shared language among developers, facilitating better communication and collaboration within teams.
   - Quality: Patterns are often derived from best practices and have been refined over time, leading to higher-quality software.
   - Learning: For novices, understanding patterns can help them learn from the experience of experts and improve their own design skills more rapidly.

## Why Patterns (Design Patterns) and What it is?
### Why Patterns (Design Patterns)?
Efficiency: Design patterns provide standard solutions to common problems, saving time and effort by avoiding the need to reinvent the wheel. This can accelerate the development process.

Reusability: Patterns encapsulate best practices and proven techniques that can be reused across different projects and contexts, enhancing the modularity and flexibility of the code.

Consistency: Using design patterns ensures a consistent approach to solving problems, which makes the codebase more predictable and easier to maintain. This consistency is particularly valuable in large teams or long-term projects.

Communication: Patterns create a common vocabulary among developers. When a specific pattern is mentioned, it conveys a wealth of information quickly and clearly, facilitating better communication and collaboration within and between teams.

Quality Improvement: Patterns are derived from best practices and have been refined over time. By applying these patterns, developers can avoid common pitfalls and ensure a higher quality of software design.

Problem-Solving Framework: Patterns provide a structured approach to problem-solving. They guide developers in identifying the most appropriate solutions based on the context and specific requirements.

Learning Tool: For novice developers, design patterns serve as an educational resource. They offer insights into effective design principles and help beginners understand how experienced developers tackle common problems.

### What is a Design Pattern?
- **A Design Pattern is a reusable and tested solution to a reoccuring problem.**
- A Design Pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into code, but rather a template or blueprint for how to solve a problem in various situations.
- Defined as description of communicating objects and classes that are customized to solve general edsign problem in particular context.

- Design patterns typically include the following elements:
  
  - Name: A descriptive name that conveys the essence of the pattern and facilitates discussion and communication.
  
  - Problem: A description of the specific problem that the pattern addresses, including the context in which it occurs and the goals that need to be achieved.
  
  - Solution: A general arrangement of objects and classes, along with their relationships, responsibilities, and collaborations, that provides a solution to the problem. The solution is often described in a way that can be adapted to different situations.
  
  - Consequences: A discussion of the results and trade-offs of applying the pattern, including potential benefits and drawbacks.

### Common Categories of Design Patterns
- Design patterns are often categorized into three main types:

  - Creational Patterns: These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, aiming to create objects in a manner suitable for the situation. Examples include the Singleton, Factory Method, and Abstract Factory patterns.
  
  - Structural Patterns: These patterns focus on the composition of classes and objects, helping to form large structures by combining objects and classes. Examples include the Adapter, Composite, and Decorator patterns.
  
  - Behavioral Patterns: These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. They help manage complex control flows and interactions. Examples include the Observer, Strategy, and Command patterns.
