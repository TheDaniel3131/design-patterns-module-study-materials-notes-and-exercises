- High coupling between system classes (colleagues): If there is high coupling between individual classes in the system, leading to complex interdependencies, consider using the "Mediator" design pattern. This pattern centralizes complex communications and control logic between classes, reducing direct dependencies between them. Meditator = bidirectional.

- High coupling within a subsystem: If there is high coupling within a specific subsystem, resulting in tightly interwoven classes, consider using the "Facade" design pattern. This pattern provides a simplified interface to the complex subsystem, decoupling the subsystem from the rest of the system and making it easier to interact with. Facade = Unidirectional.
